# AutomatedShopBot
An Automated Shopping Bot


This project will allow for requests-based automated shopping based on user input and will be applicable to various online shopping outlets. Users will be able to interact with the bot through a simple, intuitive GUI. Within the GUI users will have the capability to enter links to shopping outlets and enter tickets for items of interest within said site. The bot will continously check for when the items becomes availble or in stock and will subsequently initiaite the process of checking out and purchasing the item for the user faster than general human capabilities. 


The business model that we would employ would be that of a subscription service, where users would pay monthly payments for the ability to use our shopping bot and the suscriptions could be separated into various tiers allowing for a specific amount of tasks to be executed monthly. Marketing would largely be enacted through social media coinciding with the marketing of popular products that may sell out quickly under normal circumstances. 


We used an MIT license because it allows the user to express permission to reuse code for any purpose. The MIT license is business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization.
