# AutomatedShopBot
An Automated Shopping Bot


This project will allow for automated shopping based on your previous preferences and orders at shopping outlets. This bot will automatically determine what is needed based on what is left in a user's fridge/pantry. The bot will be able to keep track and update daily.


The business model involves marketing the software needed for the bots to make these decisions for shopping.


We used an MIT license because it allows the user to express permission to reuse code for any purpose. The MIT license is business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization.
